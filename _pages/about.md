<p style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">Hi :), I'm <b>Praneet</b> 👋</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">A 5th year Ph.D candidate at Purdue University advised by Dr. Amy R. Reibman. I love working on task-aware video compression and analytics, image quality assessment, implicit neural representations, and 3D gaussian splatting.</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Research Interests</p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px;">
  <li>Task-aware Video Analytics and Compression</li> 
     <li>Image Quality Assessment</li>
  <li>Computer Vision</li>
  <li>Multimodal Neural Field Representations</li>
   <li>Gaussian Splatting</li>
 
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Research and Practical Involvements</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
  
I am driven by the challenge of advancing practical video analytics systems and compression algorithms for critical applications like autonomous driving and security. My research at Purdue University, under Dr. Amy Reibman has focused on improving end-to-end computer vision systems through:

<ul>
 <li> Mitigating the impact of compression on deep learning models used for computer vision tasks  </li> 
  <li>  Developing balanced, interpretable evaluation methodologies for these models, and </li>
  <li>
    Designing algorithms to estimate video quality for peak system performance. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
I've also been fortunate enough to intern at Dolby and Apple. During my internships, I explored and published research on cutting-edge topics such as joint implicit neural field representations (audio + video), scalable video coding algorithms, and end-to-end learning-based compression of 3D Gaussian splats.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
With my PhD research skillset and internship experience, I strive to bridge academic excellence with practical expertise, delivering innovative and impactful solutions to complex challenges.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Future Aspirations</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
    I am excited to advance my academic journey through a graduate program in the United States, focusing on artificial intelligence. My aim is to contribute to transformative research and influence the future of technology.
