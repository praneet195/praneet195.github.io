<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">About Me</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
Hi 👋, I am a researcher passionate about redefining possibilities in the image and video domain. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
I am actively seeking research opportunities in the industry starting in May 2025 to contribute to impactful innovations and help shape the future of image and video technology.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Research Interests</p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px;">
  <li>Task-aware Video Analytics and Compression</li> 
     <li>Image Quality Assessment</li>
  <li>End-to-end Computer Vision Systems</li>
  <li>Multimodal Neural Field Representations</li>
   <li>3D/4D Gaussian Splatting</li>
 
</ul>


<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Research and Practical Involvements</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
  
During my Ph.D, I was driven by the challenge of advancing practical video analytics systems and compression algorithms for critical applications like autonomous driving and security. My research at Purdue <b>(funded by Ford Motor Corp.)</b> focuses on improving end-to-end computer vision systems through:

<ul>
 <li> Mitigating the impact of compression on deep learning models used for computer vision tasks  </li> 
  <li>  Developing balanced, interpretable evaluation methodologies for these models, and </li>
  <li>
    Designing algorithms to estimate video quality for peak system performance. </li>
</ul>


<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
I've also been fortunate enough to intern at <b>Dolby and Apple</b>. During my internships, I explored and published research on cutting-edge topics such as joint implicit neural field representations (audio + video), scalable video coding algorithms, and end-to-end learning-based compression of 3D gaussian splats.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
With my PhD research skillset and internship experience, I strive to bridge academic excellence with practical expertise, delivering innovative and impactful solutions to complex challenges.
