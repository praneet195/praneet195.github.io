<p style="font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;">Hello, I'm <b>Hasnain</b> 👋</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer and Information Systems Engineering from NED University. Currently, I work as a Machine Learning Engineer, specializing in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Research Interests</p>
<ul style="line-height: 1.6; font-size: 18px;">
    <li>Computer Vision</li>
    <li>Multimodal AI</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>

</ul>

<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Research and Professional Involvements</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
    Outside of my job as a Machine Learning Engineer, I love diving into international hackathons and tech competitions where I get to work with talented people from around the world on exciting problems. I also spend time on personal projects that let me experiment with new technologies and collaborate with others.
</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
    I’m really passionate about giving back through teaching, so I volunteer with non-profits to help underprivileged students in Pakistan learn tech skills in their local language, Urdu. To keep learning and stay inspired, I regularly take online courses and tackle new, challenging projects.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Future Aspirations</p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6;">
    I am excited to advance my academic journey through a graduate program in the United States, focusing on artificial intelligence. My aim is to contribute to transformative research and influence the future of technology.
