        <span class="timeline">Sep 2024 - Present</span>
        </div>
        <p>A robotics project that integrates a robotic arm mounted on a mobile platform to autonomously detect, navigate towards, and manipulate(lift) objects based on natural language commands using 6D pose estimation of the object. The project will utilize ROS, Gazebo, ArUco Markers, 6D pose estimator and LLMs.</p>

        <span class="timeline">May 2024 - Jul 2024</span>
        </div>
        <p>The SmartScan Billing Assistant is a computer vision-based project designed to automate the process of calculating the total bill by detecting products and adding their prices using a camera, similar to a cashier. This project uses the YOLOv8 model for object detection and tracking. This is the MVP of the main project I did for a supermarket where I implemented the SmartScan billing system on more than 1200 products.</p>
