        <h3>Compression of 3D/4D Gaussian Splats</h3>
        <span class="timeline">Sep 2024 - Dec 2024</span>
        </div>
        <p>This project was part of my fall internship at Dolby. During my internship, I designed an end-to-end neural network based compression algorithm for 3D gaussian splats. I also worked on compressing spherical harmonic coefficients of 3D gaussian splats (occupy ~50% size) using conventional inter-frame video coding tools.</p>
